## Provided datasets*

### 1. Elves table

This table contains information about each elf. The columns in this table are:

* `elf_id`: A unique identifier for each elf. This is the primary key of the table.
* `parent_id`: The elf_id of the elf's parent. If an elf does not have a parent in the table, this field is NaN.
* `name`: The elf's name.
* `age`: The elf's age.
* `savings`: The amount of savings the elf has.
* `alive`: A boolean field indicating whether the elf is alive.
* `family_id`: The ID of the family to which the elf belongs. Elves with the same family_id are part of the same family.

### 2. Forests table

This table contains information about each forest. The columns in this table are:

* `family_id`: The ID of the family that lives in the forest. This is the primary key of the table and it also serves as a foreign key that links to the family_id in the people table.
* `forest_name`: The name of the forest.
* `forest_square`: The area of the forest in square kilometers.

## Relationships between the tables

The family_id in the people table links to the family_id in the forests table. This is a one-to-many relationship from forests to people: each forest can have multiple elves (a family), but each elf belongs to exactly one forest (the one where their family lives).

This data structure allows you to answer queries such as:

* Retrieve all elves belonging to a certain family.
* Retrieve all elves living in a certain forest.
* Retrieve the forest where a certain elf lives.
* Retrieve the parent of a certain elf.
* Retrieve all siblings of a certain elf (elves with the same parent_id).
* Retrieve all descendants of a certain elf (recursively find all elves where the parent_id matches the elf_id of the elf in question).
